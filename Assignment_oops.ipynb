        "OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code. It focuses on representing real-world entities as objects with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Key principles of OOP include:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (object). This hides internal implementation details.\n",
        "*   **Abstraction:** Showing only essential features of an object while hiding complex underlying details.\n",
        "*   **Inheritance:** Creating new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base classes), inheriting their properties and behaviors. This promotes code reusability.\n",

        "- Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (the class). It also involves controlling access to the data from outside the class, typically through access modifiers.\n",

        "Q.5 What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "- Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__).\n",
        "- They are not meant to be called directly by the programmer but are invoked by Python's built-in functions or operators.\n",
        "- They allow objects to integrate with Python's language features and define how they behave in various contexts (like initialization, string representation, arithmetic operations, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6 Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "- Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class).\n",
        "- This promotes code reusability and establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes. For example, a \"Dog\" class could inherit from an \"Animal\" class, meaning a Dog *is an* Animal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7 What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "- Polymorphism means \"many forms\". In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "- It enables a single interface (like a method name) to be used to represent different underlying behaviors in different classes.\n",

        "\n",
        "-- While Python doesn't have strict access modifiers like public, private, and protected in the same way as some other languages (like Java or C++), encapsulation is achieved through:\n",
        "- 1. Bundling: Attributes and methods are defined within the class definition.\n",
        "- 2. Naming Conventions: A single underscore prefix (e.g., _attribute) is used as a convention to indicate that an attribute or method is intended for internal use within the class (though it's not strictly enforced). Double underscores (e.g., __attribute) trigger name mangling, which makes it harder (but not impossible) to access the attribute from outside the class directly, providing a stronger hint of privacy.\n",
        "- 3. Getter and Setter Methods: Providing public methods (getters and setters) to access and modify private or protected attributes, allowing for controlled access and validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9 What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "- In Python, the constructor is a special method named `__init__`.\n",
        "- It's automatically called when an object of a class is created (instantiated).\n",
        "- Its primary purpose is to initialize the attributes of the object with initial values.\n",

        "Q.10 What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "- Class Methods (`@classmethod`):\n",
        " - They are bound to the class and receive the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named `cls`.\n",
        " - They can access and modify class attributes.\n",
        " - They are often used as factory methods to create instances of the class in different ways.\n",
        " Static Methods (`@staticmethod`):\n",
        " - They are not bound to the class or the instance. They don't receive `self` or `cls` as the first argument.\n",
        " - They are essentially regular functions that are grouped within a class for organizational purposes.\n",
        " - They cannot access or modify instance or class attributes directly (unless they are passed as arguments).\n",

        "Q.11 What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "- Method overloading is a concept where a class can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number or types).\n",
        "- Python does not support traditional method overloading based on the number or types of arguments in the same way as languages like Java or C++.\n",
        "- In Python, if you define multiple methods with the same name in a class, the last defined method will overwrite the previous ones.\n",

        "- Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "- The method in the subclass has the same name, return type (in languages where this is strictly enforced), and parameters as the method in the superclass.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q.13 What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "- The `@property` decorator is a built-in Python decorator that provides a convenient way to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute.\n",
        "- It allows you to access methods as if they were attributes, providing controlled access and enabling logic to be executed when the attribute is accessed or modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.14 Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        " Polymorphism is important because it promotes:\n",
        "- 1. Flexibility and Extensibility: New classes can be added that inherit from a common superclass, and existing code that works with the superclass can automatically work with the new subclasses without modification.\n",
        "- 2. Code Reusability: Code written to operate on the superclass can be reused with any of its subclasses.\n",
        "- 3. Decoupling: It helps in decoupling the code that uses objects from the specific types of those objects, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.15 What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is designed to be a blueprint for other classes.\n",
        "- Abstract classes can contain abstract methods, which are methods declared in the abstract class but have no implementation. Subclasses are required to provide implementations for these abstract methods.\n",
        "- In Python, abstract classes are typically defined using the `abc` module (Abstract Base Classes).\n",

        "Q.16 What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "- 1. Code Reusability: Inheritance allows reusing code from parent classes.\n",
        "- 2. Modularity: Code is organized into self-contained units (objects).\n",
        "- 3. Maintainability: Changes to one part of the code are less likely to affect other parts.\n",
        "- 4. Flexibility: Polymorphism allows for flexible and extensible code.\n",

        "- Class Variables:\n",
        " - Belong to the class itself and are shared by all instances of the class.\n",
        " - Defined inside the class but outside of any instance methods.\n",
        " - Accessed using the class name (e.g., `ClassName.class_variable`).\n",
        " Instance Variables:\n",
        " - Belong to a specific instance of the class.\n",
        " - Defined within the `__init__` method (or other instance methods) using `self`.\n",
        " - Each instance has its own copy of instance variables.\n",

        "Q.18 What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        " Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        " The child class inherits attributes and methods from all its parent classes.\n",
        " While powerful, it can introduce complexities like the \"diamond problem\" if not used carefully. Python uses a Method Resolution Order (MRO) to determine the order in which base classes are searched for a method.\n",

        "Q.19 : Explain the purpose of ‘__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ methods in Python\n",
        " `__str__(self)`:\n",
        " - Returns a \"user-friendly\" string representation of an object.\n",
        " - Called by the `str()` built-in function and `print()`.\n",
        " - Should be readable and informative for the end-user.\n",
        " `__repr__(self)`:\n",
        " - Returns an \"official\" string representation of an object.\n",
        " - Should be unambiguous and ideally, if evaluated as Python code, it should recreate the object.\n",
        " - Called by the `repr()` built-in function and in interactive sessions when an object is the last expression.\n",
        " - If `__str__` is not defined, `__repr__` is used as a fallback for `str()`.\n",

        "Q.20 What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " The `super()` function is used to refer to the parent class (superclass).\n",
        " It is primarily used in the `__init__` method of a subclass to call the constructor of the parent class and initialize inherited attributes.\n",
        " It can also be used to call methods of the parent class from the subclass, especially when method overriding is involved.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.21 What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " The `__del__(self)` method is a destructor. It's called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected.\n",
        " It's often used for cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing external resources.\n",
        " However, the exact timing of garbage collection in Python can be unpredictable, so relying solely on `__del__` for critical cleanup is generally discouraged. Context managers (using `with` statements) are often a preferred way to handle resource management.\n",

        "Q.22 What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " `@staticmethod`:\n",
        " - Doesn't receive the instance (`self`) or the class (`cls`) as the first argument.\n",
        " - Behaves like a regular function but is part of the class namespace for organization.\n",
        " - Cannot access or modify instance or class state.\n",
        " `@classmethod`:\n",
        " - Receives the class (`cls`) as the first argument.\n",
        " - Can access and modify class state (class variables).\n",
        " - Often used for factory methods or alternative constructors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.23 How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        " Polymorphism with inheritance in Python is achieved through method overriding.\n",
        " If a superclass has a method, and a subclass provides its own implementation of that method with the same name, then when you call that method on an object, the version defined in the object's actual class (subclass) is executed.\n",
        " This allows objects of different subclasses to respond differently to the same method call, provided they share a common superclass with that method signature.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.24  What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "\n",
        " Method chaining is a technique where multiple method calls are linked together on a single object in a single expression.\n",
        " This is possible when each method in the chain returns the object itself (`self`) after performing its operation.\n",
        " It can make code more concise and readable for sequential operations on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.25 What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " The `__call__(self, *args, **kwargs)` method makes an instance of a class callable, just like a function.\n",
        " When you define this method in a class, you can call an object of that class using parentheses, passing arguments like you would to a function.\n",
